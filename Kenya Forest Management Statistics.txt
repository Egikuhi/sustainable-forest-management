Kenya Forest Management StatisticsForest Cover Overview* Natural forest cover is approximately 8.8% of Kenya’s land area, with tree cover at around 12.13% as of 2021 (afr100.org).* Another source notes forest cover stood at 8.8% in 2021, slightly below the constitutional requirement of 10% (Kippra).Historical Changes & Losses* Between 2002 and 2022, Kenya lost around 50,700 hectares of humid primary forest (about 14% of its total tree cover loss) (BirdLife International).* Since independence, forest cover declined from around 10% to approximately 6%, losing roughly 12,000 hectares annually (Wikipedia).* A longer-term report shows a net tree cover loss of about 285,000 hectares (6%) over the period from 2000 to 2020 (Wikipedia).Restoration Efforts* In 2022, the government officially announced achieving the 10% forest cover goal, later raising a new target of 30% by 2050 (Wikipedia).* Kenya launched a massive tree-planting effort, aiming to plant 15 billion trees by 2032, backed by over $80 million in funding (AP News).* Nonprofit initiatives like those by Nature Kenya, supported by community forestry, restored 2,200 hectares, planting over 130,000 indigenous trees in 2023 alone (BirdLife International).Summary TableCategoryStatisticForest Cover (2021)8.8% of land area (< constitutional 10% target)Tree Cover (2021)12.13% of land areaPrimary Forest Loss~50,700 ha (2002–2022)Annual Forest Loss~12,000 ha/year since independenceNet Tree Cover Loss (2000–2020)~285,000 ha (6%)Restoration Target15 billion trees by 2032Restoration Achieved (2023)~2,200 ha restored + 130,000+ trees plantedIf you'd like, I can help you draft a Word document (.docx) based on these stats—formatted and ready to include in your repository.Let me know if you'd like to proceed with that!
